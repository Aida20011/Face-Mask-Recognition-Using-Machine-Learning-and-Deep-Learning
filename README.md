This project showcases a cutting-edge Face Mask Recognition System that combines the power of advanced deep learning models with traditional machine learning techniques. It is designed to identify whether individuals are wearing masks properly, improperly, or not at all. The system supports real-time video analysis and offers robust performance even in challenging conditions.

üöÄ Key Features
Real-Time Mask Detection:

Utilizes RetinaFace for accurate face detection in live video feeds or pre-recorded footage.
Classifies faces into three categories:
No Mask
Properly Worn Mask
Improperly Worn Mask
Displays results with bounding boxes and clear annotations on detected faces.
High-Performance CNN Model:

Implements a deep Convolutional Neural Network with layers optimized for feature extraction.
Employs techniques like batch normalization, LeakyReLU activation, and dropout regularization for improved generalization.
Trained using data augmentation and validated on diverse datasets for real-world applicability.
